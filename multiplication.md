Multiplication of two integers is a mathematical operation that represents the process of adding one integer to itself a specific number of times, as determined by the other integer. It can also be thought of as finding the total number of items in a set of equal-sized groups.Example:$3 \times 4 = 12$This means adding $3$ four times ($3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12$) or adding $4$ three times ($4 + 4 + 4 = 12$).
