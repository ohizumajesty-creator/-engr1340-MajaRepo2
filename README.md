Short Explanation:
Multiplication is repeated addition. When we multiply two integers, we are adding one number to itself a certain number of times.

Simple Example:
3 × 4 = 12

This means we add 3 four times:
3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12

How Multiplication Works:
The first number (3) is called the multiplicand.
The second number (4) tells us how many times to add it.
The result (12) is called the product.
